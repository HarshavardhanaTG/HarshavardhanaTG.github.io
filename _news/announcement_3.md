As part of `Meta`'s  research on `Surface EMG Equity and Accesibility` program, our team at UC Davis studied the signal distribution shift of EMG across different individuals due to varying anatomy, physiology, and neural drive characteristics.  Work lead by me is featured in the [Meta Quest Blog](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/surface-emg-wristband-electromyography-human-computer-interaction-hci/?srsltid=AfmBOookNyarYzKdalvVvcZYu75t3if9Yfab3al21tyrdjIWWQ7SHRgC).
